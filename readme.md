# Weather Website
> A small website that takes a user entered zipcode and retrieves the current weather using the OpenWeatherMap API.

CSS icons were made by Tiffany Du and were retrieved from https://codepen.io/tiffanyadu/pen/OprNrV.
Text animations were made by Brielle and were retrieved from https://codepen.io/buntinb/pen/OEjENG.

# Issues
The OpenWeatherMap API doesn't have the most accurate zipcode data. For example, when given the zipcode of my hometown Burlington CO (80807), it gives the location as Colorado Springs.

The CSS icons don't seem to play well with the animations. When new icons are drawn there is a shift in the icons. For example, when the rain icon loads the rain lines will appear vertical at first and then shift to an angle when the animations are finished. 

# Possible Improvements
Possible improvements would include fixing the issues stated above, as well as adding an extended forecast.
